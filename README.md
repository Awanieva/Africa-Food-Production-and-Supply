# FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY IN AFRICA ANALYSIS
# INTRODUCTION
Africa is not only the second-largest continent by land area and population, but also the home of a remarkable diversity of cultures, languages, and religions.

Agriculture is by far the single most important economic activity in Africa. It provides employment for about two-thirds of the continentâ€™s working population and for each country contributes an average of 30 to 60 percent of gross domestic product and about 30 percent of the value of exports.

Peasant and subsistence farming is the basic form of agriculture in most parts of the continent. However, agriculture in Africa faces challenges such as low productivity, land degradation, climate change, gender inequality, and malnutrition. Several initiatives and organizations are working to improve the sector and help Africa reach its potential

In this project, we will be analyzing two datasets which contains information of food production and food supply from 2004 to 2013 in 45 African countries. For pattern recognition and storytelling, and their relationship

# Objective of the project
Using Python as the choice language for data analysis and visualisations, the aim of this project is to tell a story of how the world food shortage problem can be solved using appropriate visuals making each variable in the dataset purposeful without leaving anything behind

- To have a guide in this project i will be getting the following insights in both the food production and food supply data

- Which Country produces food the most

- Food that were produced the most / least

- What Food Did Nigeria Produce more from 2004 to 2013

- What Food Did Egypt Produce more from 2004 to 2013

- What Food Did South Africa Produce more from 2004 to 2013

- Who are the Top Cassava, Sugar cane, Maize and products producing countries

- Top Rice producing countries

- Did Food production in Africa from 2004 to 2013 Decrease or Increase

- Country that suppied food the most

- Did Yearly food supply in Africa from 2004 to 2013 increase or decrease?

- Detecting Outliers

- Hypothesis testing to determiene if Rice production increase as the population increases?

- Relationship between food production and food supply
